# AsphaltArtProject
## Introduction

I used my Asphalt painter to create a beach with an inlet. It uses 3 painter, one for the background and the sand. The second paints the clouds using the paintline method

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   - my project is a reprsentation of my trip to the beach with my nina. I just wanted to create the inlet that we were swimming in that day.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - I am proud of my code and how well it turned out. It was definitely hard to write all of that code. I definitely learned alot though having to learn from videos and other sources to code the beach painter. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - I would go back and try to figure out why the paint lines wouldnt work originally so i didnt have to write all of that repetitive code.
